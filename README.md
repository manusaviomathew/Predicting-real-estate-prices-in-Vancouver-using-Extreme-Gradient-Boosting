# Predicting-real-estate-prices-in-Vancouver-using-Extreme-Gradient-Boosting
This project is an attempt to create a model that identifies factors influencing real estate prices in Vancouver and use it for predicting the housing prices for detached homes,apartments and condominiums.
The dependent variables here are the benchmark housing prices obtained from the Canadian Real Estate Association which were later converted into percentage changes of housing price per month.
The data is broken down by month. Training set is from 2005 to 2017, validation set is from 2017-2018 and test set is from 2018-2019.
The independent variables include:
1. Population
2. Unemployment
3. Mortgage Rate
4.GDP
5. CPI 
6. Foreign Buyers Tax
7. Household Income
8. Per capita Income 
9. Stress Test
10. First Time Home Buyer Downpayment
11. Inflation
12. CAD to USD exchange rates
13. Dollar Volume
14. Days in market
15. Price per sqft
16. New listings
17. No of sales
18. Sales/active ratio
